        <p id="intro">Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.

    <p><span class="highlight">This topic sentence forecasts the central idea or main point of the paragraph: “politicians” and “journalists” rely on Twitter.</span> <div class="bottom-section"><span>The rest of the paragraph will focus on these two Twitter-user groups, thereby fulfilling the promise made by the topic sentence.</div></span> By avoiding irrelevant information that does not relate to the topic sentence, you can compose a unified paragraph.
